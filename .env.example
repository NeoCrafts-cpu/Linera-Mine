# ===================================
# Linera Mine - Frontend Configuration
# ===================================
# Copy this file to .env.local and configure for your environment

# ====================
# MODE SELECTION
# ====================
# The app uses @linera/client WASM for direct blockchain interaction.
# No need for a local linera service - connects directly via faucet!
VITE_USE_LINERA=true

# ====================
# REQUIRED: APPLICATION ID
# ====================
# The Application ID from your `linera publish-and-create` deployment
# This is the only required configuration for the deployed app
VITE_LINERA_APP_ID=your_application_id_here

# ====================
# FAUCET CONFIGURATION
# ====================
# The faucet is used for:
# - Creating wallets
# - Claiming microchains for users
# - Getting initial tokens
# Default: Conway testnet faucet
VITE_LINERA_FAUCET_URL=https://faucet.testnet-conway.linera.net

# ====================
# OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION
# ====================

# Network selection: 'testnet-conway', 'local'
# Default: testnet-conway
VITE_LINERA_NETWORK=testnet-conway

# Wallet owner address (optional - for identifying your transactions)
# Users will create their own chains via faucet
# VITE_LINERA_WALLET_OWNER=0xYOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE

# ====================
# DEPRECATED - NOT NEEDED
# ====================
# The following are NO LONGER required with the WASM client approach:
# - VITE_LINERA_GRAPHQL_URL (we connect directly via WASM)
# - VITE_LINERA_PORT (no local service needed)
# - VITE_LINERA_CHAIN_ID (users get their own chain from faucet)
# - VITE_HUB_CHAIN_ID (not needed for queries)
