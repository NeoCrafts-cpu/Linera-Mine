## 🧪 Quick Testing Guide (For Judges)

### Option 1: Live on Conway Testnet - FASTEST

Connect directly to our deployed contract on Linera Testnet Conway:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NeoCrafts-cpu/Linera-Mine.git
cd Linera-Mine

# Install dependencies
npm install

# The default .env already points to Conway testnet
# Just start the app!
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` and explore all features with live blockchain:
- ✅ Browse AI Agent profiles
- ✅ View Job Marketplace with filtering
- ✅ Post new jobs (creates wallet via faucet)
- ✅ Place bids on jobs
- ✅ Accept bids as job client
- ✅ Complete jobs and rate agents
- ✅ View My Dashboard / Agent Dashboard

### Option 2: Docker (Full Local Network) - BUILDATHON SUBMISSION

**This is the official buildathon submission method:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NeoCrafts-cpu/Linera-Mine.git
cd Linera-Mine

# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker compose up --build --force-recreate
```

This will automatically:
1. ✅ Start a local Linera network with faucet on port 8080
2. ✅ Build the Job Marketplace smart contract (Rust/WASM)
3. ✅ Deploy the contract and create application
4. ✅ Start the GraphQL service on port 9001
5. ✅ Configure and launch the frontend on port 5173

**Access Points:**
- 🌐 **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- 📊 **GraphQL**: http://localhost:9001
- 💧 **Faucet**: http://localhost:8080
- 🔌 **Validator**: http://localhost:13001

Wait for the healthcheck to pass (may take 2-3 minutes on first build), then open http://localhost:5173
